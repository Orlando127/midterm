<p>Life in New York City is amazing and I can’t wait for Spring Break. I leave Friday back to Texas and I could not be more excited. Flying can be terrible but one of the things I like about flying is being able to listen to music. Some new songs I have been listening to is Ariana Grande’s new song “Dangerous Women,” I love the Saturday Night Live performance and it is a great showcase of her talent. </p>

<p>Ariana’s performance in general on Saturday Night Live was a highlight for the season. Her comedic timing was on point and the skits this week were funny and entertaining. Grande introduced two new songs from her new album and I can’t wait to hear these songs for the summer.
Watch her performance of Dangerous women below!
